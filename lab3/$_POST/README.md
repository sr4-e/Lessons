$_POST
contains an array of variables received via the HTTP POST method.

There are two main ways to send variables via the HTTP Post method:

1-HTML forms:
A HTML form submits information via the HTTP POST method if the form's method attribute is set to "POST".

2-JavaScript HTTP requests
When sending a HTTP request in JavaScript, you can specify that the HTTP method is POST.
